# ToDoList :> 
I'm proud to present to you a fully functional todo list website that I have developed using EJS, JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap. This website is designed to help you efficiently track and manage your day-to-day tasks. Here's a detailed description of its features:

User Interface: The website boasts a sleek and modern user interface that is both visually appealing and intuitive to navigate. The design incorporates Bootstrap's responsive framework, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.

Task Input: To add a task, you can simply utilize the user-friendly task input form prominently displayed on the homepage. It allows you to enter task descriptions along with optional details like due dates or priority levels, enabling you to provide more context to each task.

Task List Display: The website showcases your tasks in a clear and organized manner, making it effortless to view and manage your entire task list at a glance. Each task is displayed with its relevant details, such as the description, due date, and priority level.

Task Manipulation: You have complete control over your tasks. With a user-friendly interface, you can easily mark tasks as complete or delete them as needed. These interactions are seamlessly integrated into the task list, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.

Dynamic Task Rendering: The website employs EJS templating to dynamically render your tasks on the page. As you add or modify tasks, the task list updates in real-time, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience.

Data Persistence: Your tasks are securely stored to ensure that your progress is never lost. By leveraging the power of browser storage or communicating with a server-side backend, the website guarantees persistent storage of your tasks, even if you close or refresh the page.
